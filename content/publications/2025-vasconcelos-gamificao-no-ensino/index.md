abstract: "Software Project Management (SPM) is a fundamental discipline in academic training and the software development market. However, its teaching faces challenges, highlighting the need for active methodologies to increase student engagement. In this context, gamification has been explored as a promising approach. This work presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify how gamification is applied in SPM education. Primary studies exploring different SPM subareas were analyzed. Results indicate that gamification is frequently combined with other approaches, and four main forms of application were identified: serious games, microlearning, simulations, and interactive activities."

summary: "Systematic review on the use of gamification in software project management education, presented at WEI 2025."
